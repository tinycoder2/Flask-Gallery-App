# Flask-Gallery-App

A DBMS project using flask, SQLite made by me and my teammates @R-my-T and @devika1402.

Do check the WebsiteScreenshots.pdf to see how it all turned out!

#### Note :  
In this project we have hardcoded the tables instead of making use of flasks sqlalchemy library, 
so that we would have a solid understanding of how the queries are processed.
