# Flask-Gallery-App
A DBMS project using flask, SQLite made by me and my team mates @R-my-T and @devika1402
Do check the WebsiteScreenshots.pdf to see how it all turned out!

Note : In this project we have hardcoded the tables instead of making use of flasks sqlalchemy library, 
so that we would have a solid understanding of how the queries are processed.
